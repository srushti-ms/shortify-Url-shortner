# 🔗 URL Shortener

A full-stack URL shortener web application that allows users to register and log in securely using JWT-based authentication. Authenticated users can shorten long URLs, view and manage their links from a personalized dashboard, and log out securely. The application also lets users set a custom expiration duration (in days) for each shortened URL, after which the link becomes invalid.

Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), the app offers a modern, responsive UI and secure backend for data management and user sessions.
